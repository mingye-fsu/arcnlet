The user's manual should be named "users_manual.pdf".  The actual .doc file
for the manual is located elsewhere.  Whenever the documentation is updated,
a pdf should be manually created and should overwrite the version in this folder.
The setup script will automatically include "users_manual.pdf" in the setup package

Update Nov 17: the file has been removed from the setup package. A separate documentation
download is available because the users_manual.pdf contains the installation
instructions.  The functionality of placing the manual in the program directory and having
it open when the 'Help' menu item is selected remains except that placing the file in the
program directory must be done by the user.
